Working with the project in the OpenTV IDE
------------------------------------------

To work with this project you will need to use the OpenTV IDE which is based on Eclipse.

1. Download and install the IDE from http://community.opentv.com
1. I recommend creating a new workspace in the root of the project
1. In the IDE choose **File/Import...**
1. In the resulting dialog choose **General/Existing Projects Into Workspace** and press **Next**
1. Choose the **Select Root Directory:** Radio button and **Browse...** to the root of the project
1. The sub projects should then be listed under **Projects**
1. Click **Select All** and then click **Finish**
1. You should then be able to build the projects by choosing **Project/Build All**

After you have built the projects at least once run the test application in the Virtual Set top box by:

1. Choosing the **MacrosFlow** project on the left
1. Pressing the green **Run** button at the top
1. In the resulting dialog choose **Local OpenTV Application** and press **OK**
